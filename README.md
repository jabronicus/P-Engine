# P-Engine
This is a WIP hobby game engine!

Hopefully one day it will provide a fairly simple C++ interface for building 2D/3D games with. Currently I'm working on building up a Vulkan framework, and I think I'm (hopefully) close to a working "Hello, Triangle." I do active development on a private repo, so this is just a snapshot of where the engine is; I hope to add new content as it comes!

Since I'm also using this project as a learning tool while I try to teach myself how game engines work, lots of the code is still due for cleanup, but especially in the early stages I want to work on getting the foundation in place before I worry about that. The engine is currently missing a few important features before it's able to manage and render 3D scenes (which can be governed by whatever gameplay logic the user implements), but hopefully those remaining foundational bits will be done relatively soon and I'll be able to have 3D graphics up and running.

Thanks for stopping by :)
