# P-Engine
This is a WIP hobby game engine that will hopefully one day provide a fairly simple C++ interface for building 3D games with! Currently I'm working on building up a Vulkan framework, and I think I'm (hopefully) close to a working "Hello, Triangle." I do active development on a private repo, so this is just a snapshot of where the engine is; I hope to add new content as it comes.
