# P-Engine
This is a WIP hobby game engine! So far all development and testing has been done on Windows 10, but I plan to add support for other operating systems once the engine has enough functionality to justify doing that; I'm hoping to write the engine code to be as platform-agnostic as I can until then.

Hopefully one day it will provide a fairly simple C++ interface for building 2D/3D games with. Currently I'm working on building up a Vulkan framework, and I think I'm (hopefully) close to a working "Hello, Triangle." I do active development on a private repo, so this is just a snapshot of where the engine is; I hope to add new content as it comes!

Since I'm also using this project as a learning tool while I try to learn how game engines work, lots of the code is still due for cleanup, but especially in the early stages I want to work on getting the foundation in place before I worry about that. The engine is currently missing a few important features before it's able to manage and render 3D scenes (which can be governed by whatever gameplay logic the user implements), but hopefully those remaining foundational bits will be done relatively soon.

I'm also working on comprehensive documentation, which should be added soon I hope.

Thanks for stopping by :)
